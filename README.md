# DragonEvent Plugin

A Minecraft Paper plugin for tracking dragon event achievements.

## How it works

🥚 - Anyone who enters the end during the event.
🗡️ - The person who does the final strike to the first dragon
⚔️ - The people who do any final strike to any dragon within the 24 hours after the first dragon dies.
💪🏻 - The person who does the most damage to the dragon (that doesn't have the 🗡️ reward)
🪽 - The person to get the first Elytra
📦 - The person to get the first Shulker Box

## Installation

1. Copy the latest JAR file to your Paper server's `plugins/` folder
2. Start your server
3. Use `/estart` to begin an event and `/estop` to stop it
4. Use the file the plugin creates to reward your users manually

## Permissions

- `dragonevent.admin` - Allows starting/stopping events (default: op)
- `dragonevent.participate` - Allows participation in events (default: true)
