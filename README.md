# DragonEvent Plugin

A Minecraft Paper plugin for tracking dragon event achievements.

## How it works

🥚 - Anyone who enters the end during the event.

🗡️ - The person who does the final strike to the first dragon.

⚔️ - The people who do any final strike to any dragon within the 24 hours after the first dragon dies.

💪🏻 - The person who does the most damage to the dragon (that doesn't have the 🗡️ reward).

🪽 - The person to get the first Elytra.

📦 - The person to get the first Shulker Box.

## Installation

1. Copy the latest JAR file to your Paper server's `plugins/` folder
2. Start your server
3. Use `/estart` to begin an event and `/estop` to stop it
4. Use the file the plugin creates to reward your users manually
